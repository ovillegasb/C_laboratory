# C Laboratory

Repository dedicated to do experiments in C dedicated to molecular dynamics.

I use this space to experiment with molecular simulation programs written in C. Everything I write here has been taken from free sources. Feel free to use them too.

## DrunkParticle

Drunk Particle is my first project, where I want to implement the tools in C to generate an initial box, enter atoms randomly and assign them a velocity and observe their evolution in time. In this case without applying any force, just observing the movement.
